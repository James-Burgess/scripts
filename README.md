# Setup you box with one line!

## But howww???
- Fresh install PopOS
- run `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/James-Burgess/scripts/master/setup_my_box.sh)`

## Things I still need to do:

- [ ] add ssh key from yubikey for gopass https://xeiaso.net/blog/yubikey-ssh-key-storage
- [ ] setup dev env
- [ ] add bin scripts to new repo
- [ ] collate old dots
